# BRIAN_Code
BRIAN stands for (non)Binary Responsive Intelligent AssistaNt.

It's a virtual assistant running in the terminal. The decision to run without a GUI was made to enable future development in any direction that one might be inspired to take, but also to avoid limiting BRIAN to a specific GUI framework.

Unfortunately, as of this version, a keyboard is still necessary in order to access some of the functions. Namely the input of complicated strings, such as email addresses or the user's SMTP password, which is asked for the first time the program is run.

BRIAN does require the user to "log on" at startup using a passphrase. This is a minor inconvenience intended to prevent just anyone from accessing the user's personal information.

BRIAN was created as a final project, my FIRST Python project actually, and therefore some of the functions may have been overcomplicated in order to impress the judges. At the same time, the development period was very short (approximately 8 weeks), and there is no doubt in the author's mind that there are many things that could have been done better. Much better, in fact.

In any case, here's the code. Anyone is more than welcome to modify, adapt, do whatever with the code, but please give me credit for the base project.
